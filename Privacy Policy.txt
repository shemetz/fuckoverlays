F*ck Overlays is a piece of code that runs inside your browser whenever you click on things, so that you can choose to
temporarily remove them from your screen.  That's it.

To make this work, this extension listens to right-click events on the page;  when you right-click a page element (e.g.
a login popup), a reference to that element is temporarily stored in your browser's memory, so that the extension can
hide it from view if you press the "F*ck it" context menu button.  That element reference is not kept in memory beyond
that point, nor is it sent anywhere else.

User data is not collected, not stored, and not shared.  Cookies are not used.  Your location will not be tracked.
The websites you visit will not be logged.  Your passwords will not be stolen.  Your banking account will not be hacked.
Your true name will not be revealed.  Your internet ramblings will not be used to train AI models.  No ads will be
targeted at you.  No one will know if you f*ck things other than annoying website overlays.  Your secrets are safe.

(This list is limited to actions not taken by this extensions;  other extensions, websites, the browser, or anyone
looking behind your back are still quite capable of intruding upon your privacy.)

[Unlike XScreenSaver](https://www.jwz.org/xscreensaver/google.html), the F*ck Overlays privacy policy does not list
every single thing it doesn't do, because that list is arbitrarily long.  This privacy policy file is required to
publicly share the extension on the web store, and that's the only reason it exists.  Thanks for reading it anyway.
