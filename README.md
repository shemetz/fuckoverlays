## [Install through the Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/fck-overlays-v3/ekigogeljclgoblmklfnnadfoflgfdpm)


This is a fork of https://github.com/kyrofox/fuckoverlays, updated to be compatible with the Google
Chrome [Manifest V3](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/migrate/what-is-mv3) changes.

Copying the description from
the [original extension page](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/fck-overlays/ppedokobpbdajgiejhnjfbdjlgobcpkp):

> adds a context menu to delete sign-up/sign-in overlays that prevent you from viewing a page
>
> IMPORTANT:
> F\*ck overlays is a VERY light extension to give you an option to delete anything on a webpage whenever you want. F*ck
> overlays does not remember anything you have f\*cked, so simply REFRESHING the page should cause the element to
> reappear.
>
>
> Instructions:
> Right click on an element you want to delete (usually overlays, but works with other things too).
> In the context menu, click "f\*ck it".
>
> Sometimes you might need to f\*ck multiple elements to get rid of an overlay. In the future\*, f*ck overlays may be
> expanded to support permanent deletion of elements.
